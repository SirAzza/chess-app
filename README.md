# CS 348 Final Project
An interactive database of chess games that lets the user enter any sequence of valid chess moves and view statistics about chess games that have been previously played starting from the same opening sequence of moves that the user has entered. An example application that inspired our application is the Chess Tempo chess database. We plan to use a Kaggle Dataset that consists of 3.5 million games. 

Any chess enthusiast can use our application. By creating a user account, it gives the user the freedom to add their own games and to save their favourite openings. In addition, we also plan to incorporate additional features such as searching/filtering through chess games, interactively inputting a beginning sequence of moves, viewing statistics about win/loss rates for a particular opening, and viewing statistics about the distribution of ELO ratings of players that have played a certain opening (e.g. average ELO).
